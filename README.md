# The Evolution of HTTP: A Beginner’s Journey Through the Web’s Foundation - Published on October 10, 2024

Imagine sending a letter to a friend. You write your message, put it in an envelope, address it, and drop it in the mailbox. Your friend receives the letter, reads it, and perhaps replies in the same manner. This simple exchange mirrors how the web works, with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) acting as the set of rules that govern communication between your browser (the client) and websites (the servers).

Understanding HTTP is essential for anyone diving into web development or simply curious about how the internet operates. Let’s embark on a journey to explore the evolution of HTTP, its various versions, and how each advancement has shaped the way we experience the web today.

### What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. Think of it as the language your web browser and websites use to communicate. When you type a URL into your browser, HTTP defines how your request is sent to the server and how the server responds back with the information you requested, such as a webpage, images, or videos.

+ Key Points:
    + Application Layer Protocol: Operates at the top level of the networking model, enabling communication between applications (like browsers and servers).
    + Depends on TCP/IP: Utilizes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) for reliable data transmission.
    + Default Ports:
        * HTTP: Port 80
        * HTTPS (Secure HTTP): Port 443

#### Features:
      * Single Method: Only the GET method was supported, allowing clients to request specific resources.
      * No Headers: Lacked metadata; requests and responses were straightforward.
      * Connection Closure: After delivering the requested content, the server would close the connection.
    
#### Example:
Client Request:
```
      GET /index.html
```
  Server Response:
```
    <html>Welcome to HTTP/0.9!</html>
```
+ Advantages:
    + Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
    + Lightweight: Minimal data overhead due to the absence of headers.
+ Disadvantages:
    + Limited Functionality: Could only retrieve HTML content.
    + No Metadata: No way to specify content types, lengths, or additional information
    + Inefficient Connections: Required a new TCP connection for each request, leading to increased latency.

Analogy: 
  > Imagine sending a postcard where you can only write a simple message without any additional details or formatting options.
