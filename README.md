# The Evolution of HTTP: A Beginner’s Journey Through the Web’s Foundation - Published on October 10, 2024

Imagine sending a letter to a friend. You write your message, put it in an envelope, address it, and drop it in the mailbox. Your friend receives the letter, reads it, and perhaps replies in the same manner. This simple exchange mirrors how the web works, with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) acting as the set of rules that govern communication between your browser (the client) and websites (the servers).
